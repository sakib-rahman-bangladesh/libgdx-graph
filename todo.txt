General:
1. Add support for reordering shaders in shaders nodes.
2. Allow rendering to named frame buffers.
3. Advanced control of OpenGL settings in shaders.
4. Larger shader preview popup.
5. Previews for some shader nodes.
6. Shortcut to create and connect a property, when clicking on node circle in graph.
7. Figure out why Gradient node is difficult to close (click on button).\
8. Stencil support.
9. Pipeline transitions (i.e. between scenes).
Sprite shader:
1. Split support for uniforms per shader and per sprite.
Model shader:
1. Redesign how models are added, they should be added with a tag and an interface that returns all the info required to render.
2. Rewrite how default models can be added using an adapter, that registers all the models into the pipeline with the tag(s).
3. Add support for custom attributes being specified explicitly.
4. The shaders node should allow to define the order of rendering - shader by shader, models front-to-back, models back-to-front.
Particle shader:
1. Split support for uniforms per shader, per effect, and per particle.
2. Add support for defining geometry of the particles.
3. Add support for line particles.
