General:
- Disable/enable "Up" and "Dn" buttons for shader lists.
Priority: 1, Difficulty: 2
- Allow rendering to named frame buffers.
Priority: 2, Difficulty: 7
- Advanced control of OpenGL settings in shaders.
Priority: 2, Difficulty: 5
- Larger shader preview popup.
Priority: 2, Difficulty :2
- Previews for some shader nodes.
Priority: 3, Difficulty: 8
- Shortcut to create and connect a property, when clicking on node circle in graph.
Priority: 1, Difficulty: 4
- Figure out why Gradient node is difficult to close (click on button).
Priority: 2, Difficulty: 6
- Stencil support.
Priority: 1, Difficulty: 7
- Pipeline transitions (i.e. between scenes).
Priority: 2, Difficulty: 8

Sprite shader:

Particle shader:
- Add support for defining geometry of the particles.
Priority: 2, Difficulty: 6
- Add support for line particles.
Priority: 2, Difficulty: 5
- Remove the particle generation from the libgdx-graph itself, this should be a job for the library user. Instead provide
default implementation for a generic particle generator.
Priority: 5, Difficulty: 5

Model shader:
- Redesign how models are added, they should be added with a tag and an interface that returns all the info required to render.
Priority: 7, Difficulty: 5
- Rewrite how default models can be added using an adapter, that registers all the models into the pipeline with the tag(s).
Priority: 7, Difficulty: 3
- Add support for custom attributes being specified explicitly.
Priority: 7, Difficulty: 4
- The shaders node should allow to define the order of rendering - shader by shader, models front-to-back, models back-to-front.
Priority: 8, Difficulty: 5
- Shadows support.
Priority: 8, Difficulty: 10
